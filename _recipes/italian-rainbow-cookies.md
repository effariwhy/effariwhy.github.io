## Ingredients

* 8 ounces almond paste
* 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* 4 large eggs, separated
* 1 teaspoon almond extract
* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* Red, green, and yellow food coloring
* 2/3 cup apricot jam
* 2/3 cup raspberry jam (seedless)
* 8 ounces semi-sweet chocolate chips

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and line three 9x9-inch baking pans with parchment paper.
2. In a large bowl, beat together the butter, almond paste, and sugar until light and fluffy.
3. Beat in the egg yolks one at a time, ensuring each yolk is fully incorporated. Add almond extract and mix well.
4. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour and salt.
5. Gradually add the sifted dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.
6. Divide the batter into three equal portions into bowls which leave room for stirring and folding. Add red food coloring to one portion, green to another, and leave the third portion plain.
7. In another clean, dry bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.
8. Gently fold 1/3 of the beaten egg whites into each batter until no white streaks remain. Be careful not to deflate the egg whites.
9. Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the batter until no white streaks remain. Be careful not to deflate the egg whites.
10. Once the layers are baked and cooled, spread a layer of apricot jam on top of the green layer. 
11. Place the plain layer on top of the jam, followed by a layer of raspberry jam and then the red layer.
12. Place the assembled layers in the refrigerator to chill for a few hours or overnight. This makes it easier to cut.
13. Using a double boiler, melt the chocolate chips until smooth.
14. Remove the chilled layers from the refrigerator and spread the melted chocolate mixture evenly over the top layer.
15. Place the cookies back in the refrigerator for the chocolate to set.
16. Once the chocolate is set, remove from the refrigerator and cut the layered stack into small squares.
